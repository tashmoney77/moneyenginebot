# Manual Deployment Instructions

Since automatic deployment isn't working, here are the key changes to make:

## 1. Fix Stripe URL (src/lib/stripe.ts)
Replace line 8 with:
```typescript
const response = await fetch(`/.netlify/functions/create-checkout-session`, {
```

## 2. Fix Aggressive Messaging (src/components/Chatbot.tsx)
Around line 150, change the summary generation to be more supportive:

```typescript
// If low-effort responses detected, provide gentle feedback instead of analysis
if (hasLowEffortResponses) {
  return `Hi ${firstName}! Thanks for trying out MoneyEngineBot.
